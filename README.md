A centralized chat service which gradually brings a blurred image into focus as two random users converse.

The goal of this project was not to develop using the latest and greatest of frontend web technologies,
but rather to establish an API that can be demonstrated as a use case for my up and coming project, Spect.

This project depends on NGINX to serve static HTML files.

See init/init.sh to get started.
